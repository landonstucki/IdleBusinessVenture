# Overview

This is an Idle Business Game made solely for entertainment and enjoyment.
The reason I (the developer) made this game was for practice with Kotlin and to test my knowledge with coding and new languages.
I wanted to test my developer skills by challenging myself with a new language I have never done, learning it in a week and creating a fully functional console application the following week, a total two week sprint.
